## Loot Tables

The main purpose of this website is to provide interactive pages for different loot tables
in the Vault Hunters modpack.
These pages will allow users to explore the different items that can be found in the game,
and how often they appear in the loot tables for different levels, item quantity and item rarity modifiers.
