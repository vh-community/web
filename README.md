# Unofficial Vault Hunters Community Website

[https://vaulthunters.community](https://vaulthunters.community)

This is an unofficial community website for the Vault Hunters modpack for Minecraft.

The aim of this website is to provide tools and resources for Vault Hunters players.

## Loot Tables

The loot tables are generated from the `the_vault/` folder.
This folder is part of `.gitignore`, so it's not included in the repository.

This means you can generate the loot tables yourself for your own server if you've customized them.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas for features or improvements,
please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

### Coding Standards

- Code should be written in TypeScript and React.
- Tailwind CSS should be used for styling wherever possible.

### Resources

Images and icons used on the website should be credited appropriately.
Please refer to the [public/icons/LICENCE.md](public/icons/LICENCE.md) file for more information on the sources of icons used.
